# Contributing to the Job List
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Lawrence & CSCareers Job List (inspired by [Pitt CSC and Simplify](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2024-Internships) & [Ookah](https://github.com/Ouckah/Summer2025-Internships))!

## Finding a Job to Add

- be in one of the following categories:
    - software/computer engineering
    - computer/data science
    - product management
    - quant
    - any other tech-related job
- be Nigeria or remote.
- not already exist in the job list.

## Adding a Job
Cool! You're ready to add an job to the list. Follow these steps:

1) First create a new issue [here](https://github.com/emeraldls/swe-jobs-ng/issues/new/choose).
2) Select the **New Job** issue template.
3) Fill in the information about your job into the form, then hit submit.
> Please make a new submission for each unique position, **even if they are for the same company**.

## Automatic README.md Updates
